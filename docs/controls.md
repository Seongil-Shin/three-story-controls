## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [BaseAdaptor](./controls.baseadaptor.md) |  |
|  [CameraHelper](./controls.camerahelper.md) |  |
|  [CameraRig](./controls.camerarig.md) | The CameraRig holds the camera, and can respond to [CameraAction](./controls.cameraaction.md)<!-- -->s such as Pan/Tilt/Dolly etc. It can also be controlled along a given path (in the form of an <code>AnimationClip</code>), or tweened to specified points. |
|  [Damper](./controls.damper.md) | Damper uses simple linear damping for a given collection of values. On every call to update, the damper will approach a given set of target values. |
|  [FreeMovementControls](./controls.freemovementcontrols.md) | Control scheme to move the camera with arrow/WASD keys and mouse wheel; and rotate the camera with click-and-drag events. |
|  [KeyboardAdaptor](./controls.keyboardadaptor.md) | Parse keyboard events and emit either dampened values for continuous keypresses, or trigger events named according to a provided keymapping. |
|  [PathPointsControls](./controls.pathpointscontrols.md) | Control scheme to transition the camera between specific points (frames) along a path specified through an <code>AnimationClip</code>. |
|  [PointerAdaptor](./controls.pointeradaptor.md) | Parse pointer events to emit dampened, normalized coordinates along with the pointer count (for detecting multi-touch or drag events) |
|  [ScrollAdaptor](./controls.scrolladaptor.md) | Emits normalized values for the amount a given DOM element has been scrolled through. |
|  [ScrollControls](./controls.scrollcontrols.md) | Control scheme to scrub through the CameraRig's <code>AnimationClip</code> based on the scroll of a DOM Element |
|  [StoryPointsControls](./controls.storypointscontrols.md) | Control scheme to transition the camera between given points in world space. |
|  [SwipeAdaptor](./controls.swipeadaptor.md) | Emits events in response to swipe gestures above a given threshold. |
|  [ThreeDOFControls](./controls.threedofcontrols.md) | Control scheme for slight rotation and translation movement in response to mouse movements (designed to be used in conjunction with other control schemes) |
|  [WheelAdaptor](./controls.wheeladaptor.md) | Parse mouse wheel events and emit either dampened values, or trigger events for swipes that cross a given threshold. |
