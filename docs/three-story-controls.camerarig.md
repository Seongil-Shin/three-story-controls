## CameraRig class

The CameraRig holds the camera, and can respond to [CameraAction](./three-story-controls.cameraaction.md)<!-- -->s such as Pan/Tilt/Dolly etc. It can also be controlled along a given path (in the form of an `AnimationClip`<!-- -->), or tweened to specified points.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class CameraRig extends EventDispatcher 
```
<b>Extends:</b> EventDispatcher

## Remarks

The rig is constructed of three objects, analagous to a body, head and eyes. The camera is nested in the eyes and is never transformed directly.

Instead of specifying the axis to rotate/translate the camera, [CameraAction](./three-story-controls.cameraaction.md)<!-- -->s are used. The rotation order of actions is always `Pan` then `Tilt` then `Roll`<!-- -->. The mapping of these actions to axes depends on the up axis, which defaults to `Y` (but can be changed with the [setUpAxis() method](./three-story-controls.camerarig.setupaxis.md)<!-- -->):

\* `CameraAction.Pan` rotates around the `Y` axis

\* `CameraAction.Tilt` rotates around the `X` axis

\* `CameraAction.Roll` rotates around the `Z` axis

\* `CameraAction.Dolly` translates on the `Z` axis

\* `CameraAction.Truck` translates on the `X` axis

\* `CameraAction.Pedestal` translates on the `Y` axis

Translations will be applied to the 'body' of the rig, and rotations to the 'eyes'. If an animation clip is provided, or the camera is tweened to a specific location, the rotations will be applied to the 'head', thus leaving the 'eyes' free to 'look around' from this base position.

Additionally, the default setup assumes that the rig will move forward/backward (`Dolly`<!-- -->) in the direction the camera is panned to. This can be configured through [translateAlong property](./three-story-controls.camerarig.translatealong.md)<!-- -->. It can also be overwritten by providing the component name to the [do() method](./three-story-controls.camerarig.do.md)<!-- -->, see \[src/controlschemes/ThreeDOFControls.ts\](src/controlschemes/ThreeDOFControls.ts) for an example.

To move the rig along a specified path, use the [setAnimationClip() method](./three-story-controls.camerarig.setanimationclip.md)<!-- -->, and set the names for the `Translation` and `Rotation` objects to match those of the clip. The clip should have a `VectorKeyframeTrack` for the outer position/translation object, and a `QuaternionKeyframeTrack` for the inner orientation/rotation object.
